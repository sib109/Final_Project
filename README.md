## Background
This project explores the causes of cancer. In the course of this project, 6 factors have been explored:
* Obesity
* Physical Activity
* Alcohol Consumption
* Smoking
* Poverty
* Fast Food Availability

## Data Collection
Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) is a new data catalog for demographic, public health and global health data. It was developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington and it complements HealthData.gov data and hosts large health-related datasets and is geared towards providing  innovators and entrepreneurs to access and utilize federal health related datasets.  

* Cancer mortality (number of deaths attributed to cancer per 100K people), Smoking Prevalence (number of smokers per 100 people), Alcohol Prevalence (Heavy (defined as 2 drinks per day) drinking per 100 people) data has been sourced from GHDx website (http://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-cancer-mortality-rates-county-1980-2014 )

* Obesity (number of people per 100 defined as Obese) and Physical Activity (number of people per 100 with any sort of physical activity) has been sourced from the IMHE website ( http://www.healthdata.org/us-health/data-download )
